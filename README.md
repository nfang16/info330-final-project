Lessons Learned
Introduction
Throughout my time in this course, I was introduced to SQL and the world of databases. I learned a lot about creating a functional database and the design processes behind creating a database. I learned about the importance of creating an ERD and meta-data spreadsheets in order to better organize your design decisions. I learned about the importance of abstraction layers and how to create better functionality for users. In short, I learned a lot about databases and hope to be able to apply the lessons learned to future jobs and endeavors. 
SQL
I came into this course with zero experience on SQL. I have taken other programming courses, so the technical aspect came relatively easy to be honest. I had to learn the kinks and style of the language but overall, I didnâ€™t think it was too difficult to pick up. SQL was a language I wanted to learn because of my interest in the data analytics field. It was interesting to learn about the different uses of SQL and what it can be applied for. Once I got some practice in, creating tables, views, stored procedures, and inserts became easier and easier. It was just a matter of improving upon my own knowledge and learning about conventional industry practices. 
Entity Relationship Diagrams
Creating an ERD as a first step was surprisingly helpful. It helps guide your thought process on how you want your database to be designed and how it should function. Adding the relationships between tables and normalizing the data actually made it a lot easier down the line. I initially tried to create a database without first creating an ERD and was very surprised to find that it took a lot more time. This is definitely a skill that I will be taking and applying for whatever comes later. 
Meta-Data Spreadsheets
The meta data spreadsheet was also another great planning tool that I overlooked. When first introduced, I was very surprised at how much easier it made in designing a database. In the spreadsheet, you can define all your variables, data types, and notes. Doing all the planning beforehand made it a lot less confusing as you could just refer back to the spreadsheet when creating the database. 
The Abstraction Layer
Another important concept that I learned was adding abstraction layer to a database to hide unnecessary details. I learned how to hide implementation in other programming courses, and I thought it was interesting that you were able to do the same with SQL. It creates easier user functionality and makes the source code more secure. In SQL, you can implement abstraction layers through the use of views, functions or stored procedures.
Summary
In this class, I learned a new language in addition to several new concepts that make designing easier. Taking this class forced me to practice being more detail oriented as writing a wrong line of code might create errors. It also allowed me to practice patience as trouble shooting the code would often force me to evaluate many lines of code. In conclusion, I learned a bunch of technical skills and personal skills that I am sure will come in handy later on, whether it be work or other endeavors. I appreciate the time set apart to learn more about industry standards and practices. I also appreciate the time set apart to learn other applications on reporting. It was very informative and was nice to have more insight on applicable industry practices.
